Once, a student of Rumi asked him a series of questions and his reply I feel is one of the most inspiring replies that we all can learn something from.

"What is Poison?" 

Anything which is more than our necessity is Poison. It may be Power, Wealth, Hunger, Ego, Greed, Laziness, Love, Ambition, Hate or anything.. 

"What is fear?" 

Non acceptance of uncertainty.
If we accept that uncertainty, it becomes adventure...

"What is envy?"

Non acceptance of good in others
If we accept that good, it becomes inspiration...

"What is Anger?"

Non acceptance of things which are beyond our control.
If we accept, it becomes tolerance...

"What is hatred?" 

Non acceptance of person as he is. 
If we accept person unconditionally, it becomes love...

- Rumi
